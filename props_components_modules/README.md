create-react-app=> is a software or tool to creact a react app or folder


javascript code will always run through browser

node.js
nodejs is an environment which helps you to run js code (like jdk in java)
+there is no need of browsers to run js code

npx
will download and install this creat-react-app software
running or (executing) this particular software

npm => node package manager
only download 

dependency
is the extra package or tool that you have downloaded in the project 

through npm we can download and unuinstall these dependencies
npm i dependency-name
npm uninstall dependency-name

all dependencies that you have downloaded are present in the node mudules repo


to see folder or file size(ubuntu) -> ctrl+i or properties


 npm install i -> to install all the dependencies
 node modules will not pushed to github -> .gitignore

 package.json -> dependecy, commands etc
 package-lock.json ->helps you to maintain the versions of dependecies


 public>index.html -> entry point
 src>index.js -> root element, imports App component
src>App.js -> all components will be imported here



























# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
